The big O notation for the funtion SortArray is:
  * O(n^2)
The big O notation for the StandardDeviation three implementations are:
  1- StandardDeviation1 O(n) 
  2- StandardDeviation2 O(n^2)
  3- StandardDeviation3 O(n)
What is the performance using big O notation for each function (based on both your predictions and the actual results)?
  1- SearchSorted1 O(n)
  2- SearchSorted2 O(log n)
Which function has the better performance in the worst case?
  1- SearchSorted2
